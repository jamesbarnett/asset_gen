# Assetgen

Messing around with programmatically generating placeholder assets. I am sure there are better solutions, but it afforded me an opportunity to learn some new things about mini_magick and ImageMagick... and solve my immediate needs relatively quickly.

The content below was generated by bundler and probably not valid. It's also unlikely I am going to put much time into making this gem any more "general purpose" in the near future.
